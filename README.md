## astar-algorithm

![Build Status](https://github.com/justinhj/astar-algorithm-cpp/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)

### Summary

An efficient implementation in C++ of the A* algorithm, designed to be used in high performance realtime applications (video games) and includes an optional pool memory allocator.

It accompanies this A* tutorial:
https://www.heyes-jones.com/astar.php

The A* algorithm is due to Hart, Nillson and Raphael. See https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4082128. 

This repository is dedicated to the memory of [Nils Nilsson](https://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/) who sadly passed away in 2019.

### Release notes

[v1.2](https://github.com/justinhj/astar-algorithm-cpp/releases/tag/v1.2) 
Breaking changes! C++ 11 is now the minimum required C++ standard.
User is now required to provide a Hash function for their Node type. Thanks to a contribution from @btdubs the closed 
list is now an unordered_set and this greatly speeds up the execution time of the algorithm.
Check the included demo code for examples of the Hash implementation for various Node types.

[v1.1](https://github.com/justinhj/astar-algorithm-cpp/releases/tag/v1.1) 
Code cleanup and final version that does not require C++11

[v1.0](https://github.com/justinhj/astar-algorithm-cpp/releases/tag/v1.0) 
Initial release once API stable.

### Compilation

Enter the cpp folder and run make

#### Introduction

This implementation is intended to be simple to read yet fairly
efficient. To build it you can compile, with any recent C++ compiler,
the following files :

For 8-puzzle solver

* 8puzzle.cpp
* stlastar.h
* optionally fsa.h

#### Command line 

8puzzle with no arguments runs with one of the boards in the cpp file, you can
select the one you want changing the conditional compiliation instructions. Or if you
prefer pass in a board on the command line using digits for the tile positions, where
zero is the space. The board runs from left to right, each row at a time:
	
    8puzzle 013824765

For path finder 
* findpath.cpp
* stlastar.h
* optionally fsa.h

pathfind has no arguments. You can edit the simple map in pathfind.cpp and the start 
and goal co-ordinates to experiement with the pathfinder.

#### Fixed size allocator

FSA is just a simple memory pool that uses a doubly linked list of available nodes in an array. This is 
a very efficient way to manage memory. It has no automatic resizing, so you must account for the fact it 
will use a fixed block of memory per instance and will report an error when memory is exhausted.

As mentioned briefly in the tutorial you can enable and disable the faster memory allocation. This allocates 
a fixed size block of memory, so you have to specify this size with the astar constructor. You need to enlarge 
it if you hit an out of memory assert during the search.

Compatibility notes:

This version of the code requires any standards compliant C++ using std C++11
